# Visual Stories YouTube-Style Video Update

## Overview
This update modifies the Visual Stories page to implement YouTube-style video components with the following features:

## ✅ Grid Behavior Implementation

1. **5-Second Video Previews**:
   - Each video autoplays a 5-second muted preview in the grid
   - After 5 seconds, the video pauses and resets to the beginning
   - Videos loop this 5-second preview cycle continuously
   - Play button overlay is visible on hover

2. **Visual Design**:
   - Clean video grid with rounded corners
   - Play button overlay appears on hover
   - Smooth transitions and interactions

## ✅ Fullscreen Modal Behavior

1. **Modal Features**:
   - Clicking a video opens it in a full-screen modal
   - Video autoplays with sound enabled
   - Full video controls (play, pause, fullscreen, volume)
   - Darkened background with backdrop blur
   - Close "X" button in the top-right corner
   - Video stops/pauses when modal is closed

2. **User Experience**:
   - ESC key support to close modal
   - Body scroll locking when modal is open
   - Consistent styling with existing image modal

## ✅ Component Implementation

### VideoLightbox.jsx (New Component)
A reusable component with the following props:
- `videoSrc`: Path to the video file
- `isOpen`: Boolean controlling modal visibility
- `onClose`: Callback function to close the modal

### VisualStories.tsx (Updated Component)
Modified to include:
- 5-second autoplay previews with mute
- Play button overlay on hover
- State management for video modals
- Integration with VideoLightbox component

## Technical Details

### Video Preview Logic
- Videos autoplay muted for 5 seconds
- After 5 seconds, videos pause and reset to beginning
- New 5-second cycle starts automatically
- Hover shows play button overlay

### Modal Behavior
- Unmuted autoplay when modal opens
- Full browser video controls enabled
- Proper cleanup when modal closes
- ESC key and click-outside closing

### Styling Consistency
The VideoLightbox component follows the same patterns as the image modal:
- Same backdrop styling (`bg-black/90`, `backdrop-blur-sm`)
- Same animation transitions (spring physics)
- Same close button styling and positioning
- Same responsive sizing (`max-w-[60vw]`, `max-h-[60vh]`)
- Same shadow and rounded corner styling

## Files Created/Modified
1. `src/components/VideoLightbox.jsx` - New reusable component
2. `src/components/VisualStories.tsx` - Updated with preview logic and modal integration

## Usage
The implementation is ready to use. Videos in the Visual Stories grid will now:
1. Autoplay 5-second muted previews
2. Show play button overlay on hover
3. Open in a YouTube-style modal with full controls when clicked

This update only affects the Visual Stories page and does not modify any other pages in the application.
